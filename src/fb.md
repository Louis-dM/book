# First Block

## Choosing your Orientation

x2y is highly recommended. It is the minimal orientation that enables you to use ANY premade pairs. If you have to adopt y or x2y2 instead, the probability is reduced by half, so you'll get more difficult cases on average, but it's still somewhat acceptable. Anything below y or x2y2 would heavily limit your choices, and is recommended against.


<!-- (on a side note: x2y2 means that you're more sensitive to the L/R sides as their colors are fixed.  ) -->

Regarding CN: it is a plus, but no one really knows the benefits because there has yet to be a faster CN rouxer yet, and some speculate it wouldn't change much because there's not enough time to go over all 24 options. However, a counterpoint would be that now for any first square, you have two choices of last pair to extend it to a FB, which means the last pair case would be much better on average. Therefore, once you find a good first square, you can pretty much settle on it and make use of your inspection time further into the solve. TL;DR: CN Roux is worthy of exploring, but don't force yourself.

If you are intersted in the average movecount comparison of FB or FB + DR under different orientations, use the following resource:

## Blockbuilding Strategies

There are broadly speaking two families of FB building strategy: Square + pair, and line + line. See resource below:

## Turning

- You want to have calm and fluid turning for two reasons:
    - You need to give yourself time to track SB pieces, and turning too fast can result in losing track of things.
    - FB is a bad moveset group that generally involve both F and B moves. It is intrinsically more difficult to fingertrick. If you rush, you could overshoot or get your grips wrong and result in bad lock-ups.

-  Plan out your fingertricks in inspection too:
   - Unlike the rest of solves, FB fingertricking requires your active attention. Limit your regrips and eliminate pauses between moves. Try to figure all these out in inspection --- This can be just as important as planning out the actual solution! Over time, you'll be familiar and be able to planning fingertricks automatically.

- Also, develop a preference for what pairs / triggers are easy to execute over time, and try to prioritize them in your FB solution. Use this to guide your FB planning instead of move count as this is more precise and correlated to actual times.

## How To Bring your inspection down to 15 seconds


- [Partial SpeedBLD technique by Kian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KLFyN6ZDwk) - This is definitely underrated as a practice approach! Do them regularly, as warmups before solves!
